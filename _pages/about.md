- I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Visual Intelligence Department of Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore. 

- I obtained my Bachelor Degree from Beijing Institute of Technology at 2013 and PhD Degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore at 2019. After graduation, I have been working in I2R, A*STAR as a research scientist.

- My current reserach interests are in thoery and application in machine learning, deep learning and computer vision.
